<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Lakshitha Dassanayake. I consider myself a dynamic professional,<br/>  
  who excels in HVAC & LV Design Engineering specializing in BMS<br/>
  and Lighting Controls. I am passionate about being innovative in<br/> 
  a challenging environment that would enable me to enhance and utilize my<br/> 
  skills and capabilities successfully, leading to self-growth and career<br/> 
  progression while assisting the employer in achieving their desired goals.</p>
  
  <p>Nowadays, I am working towards becoming a Web developer. A dream of mine, <br/>
  which I had manifested while working as an electronic engineer. Embedded Systems<br/>
  have a controlling aspect to it, which has to do with a bit of coding.<br/>
  That was when I found the fun in coding. But the application of it<br/>
  was not the most appealing for myself. Then I decided to quit my job and<br/>
  go on a journey to become a Freelance Web developer. An entrepreneur<br/>
  working towards a dream while living the dream!
